# Commenting in VSCode Guide

---

## Introduction

- Comments are a way to annotate and explain your code in programming files. In VSCode, there are multiple types of comments and ways to perform them.

## Types of Comments

#### Single-line Comment

- A single-line comment is a one-line annotation often used to explain code in a single line.

#### Multi-line Comment

- A multi-line comment is a multi-line annotation often used to explain longer pieces of code or code blocks.

## How to Comment

#### Single-line Comment

- To create a single-line comment, you can use the "//" symbol. For example:

  ```sh
  // This is a single-line comment
  ```

#### Multi-line Comment

- To create a multi-line comment, you can use the "/\*_ ... _/" symbols. For example:

  ```sh
  /**
   * This is a multi-line comment
   * Second line of the comment
   */
  ```

## Comment Shortcut

- To quickly comment or uncomment a line or a block of code, you can use the shortcut:

  ```sh
  Linux/Windows: Ctrl + /
  Mac: Command + /
  ```

- When you select a line or a block of code and use this shortcut, it will automatically add or remove the comment symbols for you.
